## Step 5: Add Credentials to Your Website

### 5.1 Create Local Environment File

1. Open your project folder: `/Users/oyiekd/Desktop/Lookwithinlifecoaching/lookwithin-app/`
2. Create a new file called `.env.local` (if it doesn't exist)
3. Add the following lines:

```env
# Google Places API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=your_place_id_here
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key
5. Replace `your_place_id_here` with your actual Place ID
6. Save the file

### 5.2 Update Other Environment Files

**For Development (.env.development):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=your_place_id_here
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**For Production (.env.production):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACE_ID=your_place_id_here
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 5.3 Important Security Notes

- **NEVER** commit `.env.local` to Git
- The `.env.local` file should already be in `.gitignore`
- When deploying, add these environment variables to your hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify)

```

You should see JSON response with your business details.

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Monitor API usage** monthly in Google Cloud Console
- **Check for billing alerts** (should stay within free tier)
- **Review cached data** to ensure it's updating properly

### Updating Reviews

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Monitor API usage regularly
- Use server-side API routes for sensitive operations

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Commit API keys to Git
